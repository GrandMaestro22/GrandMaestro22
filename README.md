Hi there 👋
I'm Ebube. I'm a Computer Science Student looking to strengthen my skills in Programming and all things computers!
Currently, I'm learning C++, and I post projects I've made here on GitHub. I would love to get help on my code to learn from any of my mistakes, so I could write better code overall.
